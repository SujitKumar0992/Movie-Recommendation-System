# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of user ratings for movies and other relevant features such as genre, cast, director, and more, build a machine learning model that can predict which movies a user will like and recommend them accordingly.

## Solution
The task involves exploring the data, preprocessing and cleaning it, selecting relevant features, building a suitable machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. The ultimate goal is to create a recommendation system that can accurately predict a user's movie preferences and suggest new movies that they are likely to enjoy. This can help increase user engagement and satisfaction with a movie streaming platform, as well as help users discover new movies that they may not have otherwise found.

## Results
The movie recommendation system was based on content-based filtering
We recommend on the basis of similarity score
The performance of the recommendation system can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and can be further optimized using techniques such as matrix factorization


## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. Streamlit
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. pickle
5. similarity.pickle
6.procfile


### Step 5 - Run the application server
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
